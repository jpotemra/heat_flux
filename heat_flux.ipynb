    "The transfer of heat and momentum are main way in which the ocean and atmosphere interact.  Surface heat fluxes are a major component in the temperature balance of the upper ocean (among other things), and are therefore represent an important consideration in climate studies involving upper ocean dynamics.  There are four main components to ocean surface heat fluxes: incoming shortwave radiation ($Q_{S}$), outgoing longwave radiation ($Q_{L}$), latent ($Q_{E}$) and sensible heat ($Q_{H}$).  Net surface heat flux, $Q_{NET}$, is the sum of these four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "Q_{NET} = Q_{S} - Q_{L} - Q_{E} - Q_{H}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two are considered \"radiative\" terms, and can be (at least in part) measured directly.  The second two are \"turblent\" fluxes and are typically computed from \"bulk formulae\" based on measured state variables such as temperature, humidity, _etc._\n",

    "## Shortwave Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance provides shortwave radiation to the Earth's surface.  The amount of shortwave radiation reaching the ocean surface depends on atmospheric conditions (mostly clouds). The amount of $Q_{S}$ that is aborbed by the ocean is then a function of the amount reaching the surface less the amount that is reflected back (albedo).  This may be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "Q_{S} =  ( Q_{cls} - Q_{cld} ) - Q_{ref} \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The clear-sky irradiance ($Q_{cls}$) is a function of time and latitude.  The time dependence has two parts: the time of day (e.g., $Q_{cls}$ would be zero at night and peak near mid-day) and the day of the year (the noontime solar angle changes seasonally).  $Q_{cld}$ is a function of atmospheric conditions (clouds), while $Q_{ref}$ is a function of the surface type (reflective or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to compute $Q_{S}$, _e.g._ , use an equation to compute $Q_{cls}$, assume an albedo (and therefore $Q_{ref}$ and use observations to get the cloud cover.  In this case, $Q_{S}$ is given by:\n",

    "Q_{S} = ( 1 - \\alpha ) Q_{I}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the albedo or $\\frac{Q_{ref}}{Q_{I}}$ (the ration of reflected and total incoming short-wave radiation.  Numerical models use a parameterization that typically includes a constant albedo and time-varying cloudiness ($n_{c}$):\n",

    "Q_{S} = ( 1 - 0.62 n_{c} + 0.0019 \\theta )\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{c}$ is the fraction of cloud cover (0 being clear sky, 1 meaning complete coverage) and $\\theta$ is the noon solar angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moorings on the other hand measure the net downward short-wave at the ocean surface (mooring tower).  This measurement includes any cloud effects, thus is a measurement of $Q_{I}$; $Q_{obs} = Q_{I}$.  The calculation of $Q_{S}$ therefore reduces to $Q_{S} = ( 1 - \\alpha ) Q_{obs}$.  Most (e.g., Cronin and McPhaden [1997]) use a constant albedo of 0.055.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the ocean surface the calculation is a little more complicated since the atmosphere can act to both reflect and emit additional longwave radiation.  This effect can be parameterized in a few different ways (see Fung et al. 1984 Reviews of Geophysics).  These follow a similar form, and one widely use one is by Hastenrath and Lamb (1978)\n",

The latter coming from atmospheric effects.  They further state under clear-sky conditions, the above equation reduces to:\n",
